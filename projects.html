                <div aria-label="project1-detail">
                    Trained a facial recognition system from scratch which can recognize the emotion and races by analyzing
                    images/videos.<br>
                    Extracted race and face features from training set and trained data according to two strategy, one versus one and one
                    versus all, using four different classifiers which are Support Vector Machine, Training Tree, Logistic Regression and
                    MLP classifier in Python.<br>
                    Designed real-time recognition by extracting features from camera with FPS over 10, testing the data in the trained
                    model and giving a recognition of six basic emotional expressions and four human races with accuracy of 80%.<br>

            <li aria-label="project2">Project on Iris Recognition System</li>
                <div aria-label="project2-detail">
                    Designed an iris recognition system in MATLAB using datasets collected by LG2200 as probes and LG4000 as
                    galleries, each of which contains 220 subjects' left and right eye images.<br>
                    Handled with invalid data and optimized the model and parameters given in an open source iris recognition software.<br>
                    Evaluated the final iris recognition system and get an equal error rate of 8% in ROC and a Rank One Recognition Rate
                    of 90.4% in CMC.<br>

            <li aria-label="project3">Project on Computer Networking's Different Layers</li>
                <div aria-label="project3-detail">
                    Designed a reliable streaming transport protocol on top of UDP using BSD socket class in Python. This protocol can
                    handle with chunking of large packets, packets reordering, packet loss rate of 0.2 and bit corruption rate of 0.2. Nagleâ€™s
                    Algorithm is implemented to minimize the total number of bytes transmitted and make the protocol much more
                    efficient.<br>
                    Built a simple web client and a web server using BSD socket interface in Python and test them in Linux environment.
                    The web client can deal with redirection. The web server can support multiple connections at one time.<br>
                    Implemented the Link-State and Distance-Vector algorithms in a routing simulator using Python. It took less than 10
                    seconds to run a 100-node event with LS algorithm which required 200,000 messages.<br>

                    Assisted the teacher to do some research on Embedded System Design.<br>
                    Worked on the design of HDMI controller, HDMI AXI-lite interface and AXI-full interface.<br>
                    Conducted innovative experiments to design the program of dodging marbles based on FPGA.<br>
